This is a repo to my personal Cv created with Reactjs.  The interface has a button to download it as a pdf file.  As stated, I developed it using reactjs, styled-components and [KendoReact PDF Processing Component for React (React PDF Generator)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@progress/kendo-react-pdf).

The screenshot below is an example of how it looks.
